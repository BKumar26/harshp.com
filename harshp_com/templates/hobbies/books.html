      <p>I've been fond of reading ever since I can remember the shapes of letters. You know those little books kids get to learn the alphabet? The ones that show <i>A</i> is for <i>Apple</i> with a big red picture of an apple next to it? I was never happy with it. I wanted more. When the librarian at the school or the naval quarters where we lived told me I couldn't have a big novel because I was too small, I was pissed. I wanted to read what I wanted to, and I wanted to read everything.</p>
