<h1>polymathy</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">Polymath</a> is a person who knows a lot about a lot of things. That's what I want to be. I want to learn about everything. Little bits, medium chunks, massive troves of knowledge, I'll suck them all in. It's insanely difficult. I leak stuff out of memory faster than I'm putting it in. But somehow the larger chunks of understanding and wisdom manage to stay, and I feel content knowing a little about something after all.</p>
